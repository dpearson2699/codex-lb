# Routing Strategy Guide

The dashboard setting **Routing strategy** controls how eligible accounts are selected for each request. No strategy can guarantee account-safety outcomes; conservative use still depends on staying within OpenAI terms, using normal request volumes, and avoiding traffic patterns that would be unusual for your accounts.

For low-volume, policy-compliant personal use, start with **Capacity weighted** or **Relative availability** and keep sticky threads enabled. Those strategies preserve session locality while avoiding sudden all-traffic shifts to a single account.

| Routing strategy | Behavior | Trade-offs and recommended use |
|---|---|---|
| Capacity weighted | Prefers accounts with more usable quota headroom. | Good default for mixed pools and normal compliant usage. |
| Relative availability | Draws from the strongest available accounts with configurable weighting. | Smooths distribution while still preferring healthier accounts. |
| Usage weighted | Reacts to observed recent usage. | Useful when usage history should influence selection, but less direct than capacity-based routing. |
| Round robin | Cycles evenly through eligible accounts. | Simple and predictable, but ignores quota shape and reset timing. |
| Fill first | Uses one account heavily before moving on. | Best for controlled drain tests; less conservative for everyday traffic. |
| Sequential drain | Drains accounts in a fixed order. | Useful for maintenance or explicit account rotation, not a normal safety-first default. |
| Reset drain | Prioritizes capacity near reset windows. | Helps consume expiring quota, but can create timing-shaped bursts. |
| Single account | Pins all traffic to one selected active account. | Useful for isolation and debugging; no load balancing. |

Change the strategy live in the dashboard under **Settings → Routing** — no restart required.

## Inspect affinity decisions

Request logs record `sticky_key_source`, `sticky_kind`, and `sticky_key_hash` for Responses and compact traffic without enabling trace logs. Callers with `conversations:read` permission can read them as `stickyKeySource`, `stickyKind`, and `stickyKeyHash` through `GET /api/request-logs`. Responses without that permission hide these fields.

The hash is the first 16 lowercase hexadecimal characters of SHA-256 over the UTF-8-encoded resolved selection key. Compare hashes to identify repeated keys; raw session headers can differ from selection keys. Historical rows and paths without an observation return null. Source `none` means resolution explicitly found no affinity.

Each row keeps its existing meaning: direct streams can emit attempt rows; compact, native WebSocket, and bridge rows describe their final request state. A final row does not enumerate every retry. Existing recovery can clear a key, leaving a null hash with the original source classification. These fields do not by themselves explain account-owner precedence or why an account was skipped.

The columns follow existing request-log retention and never store raw keys or prompts. See the [affinity observation contract](https://github.com/Soju06/codex-lb/blob/main/openspec/specs/proxy-runtime-observability/spec.md) and [query example and privacy notes](https://github.com/Soju06/codex-lb/blob/main/openspec/specs/proxy-runtime-observability/context.md#affinity-decisions-in-request-logs).

## Routing, quotas, and eligibility explainer

### Account eligibility vs displayed status

An account's badge (`Active`, `Paused`, `Limited`, …) is its **displayed status**, derived from the durable account state plus current usage. Eligibility is decided **per request**: the selector can skip an `Active` account because of a cooldown, error backoff, a quota threshold or exhaustion, model/plan incompatibility, or because a thread's continuation state is owned by a different account. `Active` therefore does not mean "will serve the next request".

### Soft sticky routing vs hard Codex continuation affinity

These are two different mechanisms:

- **Soft sticky routing** (the `Sticky threads` toggle and session/thread locality) is a *preference*: keep requests for the same session on the same account when possible, mostly to preserve warm upstream prompt caches. When the preferred account is unavailable or over the sticky thresholds, traffic can move.
- **Hard Codex continuation affinity** binds a request to the account that owns its continuation state — an explicit Codex turn state, a stored `previous_response_id`/conversation, or uploaded file ids. This binding is **not controlled by `Sticky threads`**: turning the toggle off does not make owner-bound requests portable. codex-lb releases the binding only when it can prove the request is a safe, account-neutral replay (or the continuation is migrated).

If a thread's owner account becomes unavailable, requests that still require that owner can fail with `No available accounts` even though the rest of the pool is healthy. Starting a fresh thread (no continuation state) routes normally.

### Primary vs secondary quota, used vs remaining

- **Primary quota** is the short **5-hour** usage window.
- **Secondary quota** is the longer window: **weekly** on most plans, or **monthly** on plans that report only a monthly window (the monthly window is normalized into the secondary slot for routing).

Account pages display each window as **percent remaining**; the sticky reallocation thresholds in Settings are **percent used**. A `Sticky secondary threshold` of `70` means "move sticky sessions off an account once more than 70% of its secondary (weekly or monthly) window has been used" — in quota terms, once less than 30% remains. Note that routing evaluates thresholds against reported usage **plus temporary in-flight pressure** (concurrent requests and leased tokens), so reallocation can begin slightly before the raw account-page numbers reach the threshold. The size of that pressure (in-flight penalty per request, leased-token weight), the account lease TTL, the overload isolation window and the error-rate weighting switch are dashboard settings under **Settings → Advanced → Routing weights and overload isolation**; a field left empty inherits the environment value or the default.

### Prefer earlier reset

When enabled and several accounts are otherwise eligible, selection is restricted to the accounts whose selected quota window (5h or weekly) resets soonest. Weekly resets are compared in whole-day buckets; when the selected window has no known reset time, the other window is used as a fallback. The preference applies to the `Capacity weighted`, `Usage weighted`, and `Fill first` strategies; the fixed-order and draw-based strategies (`Round robin`, `Relative availability`, `Sequential drain`, `Reset drain`, `Single account`) ignore it.

### Relative latency weighting

The `Capacity weighted` and `Relative availability` strategies also discount accounts that are slower than their siblings, down to half of their normal weight, using two replica-local signals measured from the last hour of successful, unqueued, single-attempt turns:

- **First-token latency** per account (measured from the upstream send, so the proxy's own pre-send work is not the account's), on small, low-effort turns: an account more than 15% above the fleet median is discounted.
- **Output throughput** (tokens per second from the first token to the upstream's terminal event as it was parsed -- downstream delivery and local settlement time are not generation time) per account **and per model**, on turns with at least 200 output tokens: an account more than 15% below the fleet median *for the model being requested* is discounted for that model only, so an account that streams slowly on one model keeps its full weight on the others.

Each signal needs at least eight samples on at least three accounts (per model, for throughput) before it acts and is neutral when the whole fleet is equally slow. When both apply, the smaller multiplier is used, never their product. The weight never excludes an account and never moves an established sticky session; there is nothing to configure.

### Limit warm-up

Limit warm-up sends **one small real request** (using the configured warm-up model and prompt) to an opted-in account when one of its quota windows is confirmed to have newly reset, verifying that the account responds. It consumes a small amount of quota. The optional staggered idle mode additionally pre-starts the 5h window of idle opted-in accounts before traffic arrives; the configured cooldown applies to these staggered idle probes, while ordinary reset-confirmed probes fire once per confirmed reset. Accounts opt in individually (`Enable warm-up` in account actions); the last attempt's result, model, and time are shown on the account list entry.

## Subscription-exhaustion overflow to a model source

> **Status: shipped, ship-dark.** Overflow routing is in this release and inactive until a source is designated: with the control **Off** (both settings columns `null`) the request path performs no probe, pin lookup, source selection or body walk and an exhausted pool answers exactly as before, byte for byte. **Production flip gate:** do not designate a source in production before every replica runs the release that contains the wired anchors and the WebSocket parity (this one); rehearse on a canary first (see [Canary and drills](#canary-and-drills)). Owning spec: [model-source-routing](https://github.com/Soju06/codex-lb/tree/main/openspec/specs/model-source-routing); design: issue [#2123](https://github.com/Soju06/codex-lb/issues/2123), which supersedes the earlier proposals in #428 and #1664.

**Settings → Routing → "Overflow to model source when all subscription accounts are exhausted"** designates one OpenAI-compatible model source with Responses support as the place new requests go when the whole subscription pool is out of usage. It is **orthogonal to `Routing strategy`**: the strategy still decides which subscription account serves a request while any account can; overflow only answers the question "what happens when none can". Default **off**; the setting names an operator-owned paid source, so it can never be a default.

### Trigger

Overflow triggers only on **pool-wide usage exhaustion** — the exact condition that today returns `429 usage_limit_reached` with `resets_at` (every eligible account is `QUOTA_EXCEEDED` or `RATE_LIMITED` with used ≥ 100 % evidence). It never triggers on per-account capacity caps, API-key fair-share throttles, transient upstream errors, authentication failures, or a single account's rate limit: those keep their current answers.

### Eligibility

- New conversations, or requests without prior reasoning, on standard Responses models. The **gpt-5.6 family cannot overflow in this version** (its Responses-Lite / code-mode request bodies are not portable to an OpenAI-compatible source); the preflight marks those models.
- Unscoped API keys only. A key scoped to a set of sources already routes to them directly and never overflows; the preflight counts such keys.
- Background jobs never overflow, except Codex's user-initiated `review`, `compact` and `collab_spawn` subagents; a memory-generation request (`x-openai-memgen-request`) never does. Requests bound to a ChatGPT account mid-turn (a binding `x-codex-turn-state`) and native Codex requests without a `thread-id` keep today's `429`.
- The trigger and every decline are decided once, at route admission, before any account is selected or reserved. Exhaustion discovered later in a turn keeps today's terminal answer; the next request overflows.
- Declare the non-function tool types your source accepts (`custom`, `apply_patch`, `web_search`, `shell`, `tool_search`) on its model entries (`supports_search_tool`, `experimental_supported_tools` in the model's raw metadata). The preflight lists the undeclared types per model, together with missing vision, missing streaming, missing pricing (the cost tile shows $0) and a context window that is missing or smaller than the registry's (Codex compacts on the registry's arithmetic, so a smaller window fails every turn with a pre-stream 400).

### Stickiness and the drain window

A conversation that received source output is **pinned** to the source and stays there (7-day idle limit) from any Codex process, `codex resume` or API key -- even after the subscription pool recovers. The pin is written together with the source's `response.id` anchor (for SDK `previous_response_id` chains) before the first content-bearing frame reaches the client, so a failed or abandoned attempt leaves the conversation on subscription. The request the source receives carries the client's own `store` (omitted when the client omitted it; Codex's `store: false` verbatim), not the `store: false` the ChatGPT backend requires, so an SDK chain is actually stored where its anchor points; an SDK request sent with `store: false` is not anchored. A model source that has not minted a `response.id` by its first content-bearing frame cannot serve `store`-enabled (SDK) overflow turns at all: the anchor its client would chain on cannot be built, so the turn is refused with `subscription_overflow_pin_unavailable` (retryable) instead of being delivered with a chain that resolves nowhere, and the WARN line names `reason=anchor_unresolved`. Codex's own `store: false` turns are unaffected -- they are served through their thread pin alone. A pinned conversation may switch to any model the source serves; a model another model source serves directly is still decided by the pin -- served by the pinned source when it lists the model, otherwise treated as a model the pinned source does not serve, so the other source never receives the pinned transcript; a model the source does not serve, a source that is disabled or deleted, and an expired pin end reasoning-bearing conversations with `400 subscription_overflow_source_unavailable` (or `subscription_overflow_unsupported_input` for an expired one) and return the others to subscription once the pin is durably deleted. An image (`input_image`) on a pinned conversation needs the source model's vision (`supportsVision` on the model entry, which the preflight warns about); otherwise the turn is refused with `400 subscription_overflow_unsupported_input` naming images, and the pin is kept. **Compaction is unavailable on the source**: `/responses/compact` on a pinned conversation is refused with `400 subscription_overflow_unsupported_input`, and Codex has no local fallback, so a pinned conversation that fills its context must be restarted (forwarding compaction to the source is planned for a later version). Turning overflow **off** stops fresh overflow immediately and arms a drain deadline: conversations already on the source keep working for at most 7 more days, then expire. While that is running the dashboard shows the date by which every pinned conversation has expired (`subscriptionOverflowPinsExpireBy`, the switch-off time plus 7 days) — not the drain deadline itself (`subscriptionOverflowDrainUntil`, the switch-off time plus 29 days), which additionally spans the 21-day tombstone grace during which an expired conversation is still recognised as pinned and handled like one on a disabled source instead of being treated as new. Designating a source again clears both.

### Kill switches

| Action | Effect |
|---|---|
| Set the control to **Off** | No new overflow; pinned conversations drain for ≤ 7 days. |
| Disable the source (or the model on it) | Immediate. Reasoning-bearing pinned conversations end with an error; the others return to subscription accounts. |
| Delete the source | Clears the designation and arms the drain window in the same transaction; pinned conversations behave as for a disabled source. |

### Client behaviour

- **WebSocket.** Sources are served over HTTP only. A handshake carrying pin evidence (a live pin, an expired pin, or a bounce from the last 60 s) is denied with HTTP `426` (`subscription_overflow_requires_http_transport`), which makes Codex switch **that session** to HTTP until the process restarts -- this needs **Codex 0.99.0 or newer** (0.93-0.98 switch only after their WebSocket retry budget, about 6 s; 0.92 and older never use WebSocket). A handshake without evidence is accepted even when the pool is exhausted. When exhaustion hits during an open session, Codex receives an in-band `503 model_source_requires_http_transport` event and the proxy records a 60 s bounce, so Codex's automatic retry re-handshakes, meets the `426` and completes the turn over HTTP; a pinned conversation on an open socket is bounced the same way. The HTTP bridge never enters overflow.
- **Hint on the 429.** When a conversation cannot overflow only because it already contains prior reasoning, the `429` carries a hint: native Codex shows "You've hit your usage limit. Start a new conversation to continue on the configured overflow model source, or try again at ..." (header `x-codex-promo-message`); SDK clients get the sentence appended to `error.message`. No other decline carries a hint, and the rest of the answer is byte-identical to today's.
- **Headers toward the source.** Requests to the source carry only headers the proxy constructs (`Authorization` from the source credential, `Content-Type`, `Accept`); no client or ChatGPT-internal header (`session-id`, `thread-id`, `x-codex-*`, `x-openai-subagent`, `chatgpt-account-id`, the client's `authorization`, ...) is forwarded -- for direct routing and overflow alike.
- Codex retry semantics for answers on this path: `429` is not retried (`retry_429: false`) and surfaces as "exceeded retry limit, last status: 429" — a source's own rate limit is therefore visible only as that message; `5xx` is retried (`retry_5xx: true`) through the usual reconnect ladder; `400 invalid_request_error` is rendered immediately.
- `/status` shows the subscription pool, not the source. Forked conversations may replay reasoning the source cannot read. While overflow is on or draining, routing depends on the proxy database being reachable: every native request with a `thread-id` and every `previous_response_id` request performs one bounded pin read (also when a model source serves the requested model directly), and a database outage fails those requests closed with a fast `503 model_source_unavailable` (WebSocket handshakes with `426`) rather than sending a possibly source-served conversation to a subscription account; requests without either header are unaffected.
- Transient trouble on a pinned conversation (source breaker open after 3 failures, source at `max_concurrency`, pin read timeout) answers `503` with `Retry-After`, never `429`; a fresh request in the same situation simply keeps today's `429`. After the 30 s open window one request is admitted as the trial; the breaker closes again as soon as that trial yields its first output item (other requests flow while it is still streaming), and a stream that stalls or drops after its first item counts as one failure toward the next trip.
- Limited API keys stream live and are charged an estimate when the source omits usage or the client disconnects mid-answer; fast mode is served at standard tier on the source.

### Note on the bridge's usage-limit answer

Since the WP-E fix in #2124 the HTTP Responses session bridge returns the pool's `429 usage_limit_reached` immediately instead of waiting out the capacity window, so a client sees the same exhaustion answer on both the direct and the bridged path. Overflow replaces that answer on the direct HTTP routes only; the bridge keeps it.

### Observability

- `codex_lb_subscription_overflow_total{route,outcome}` counts every decision: `dispatched_fresh|pinned|anchor`, `declined_<reason>`, `pinned_unservable_*`, `pinned_released_neutral`, `pinned_lookup_timeout`, `pin_commit_failed|unverified`, `bounced_ws_handshake|event`, `decision_error`; `codex_lb_model_source_breaker_state{source_id}` (0 closed, 1 open, 2 half-open); `codex_lb_model_source_live_pins{kind}`, sampled once per hourly retention tick on the leader replica; `codex_lb_model_source_dispatch_total{kind=fresh|pinned|anchor}`.
- Request-log rows for overflow attempts carry `source` `subscription_overflow` (fresh) or `subscription_overflow_pinned` (pinned and anchored), no account, the source id, `requested_service_tier` and a null `service_tier`; estimates charged to limited keys are never written as usage. The dashboard attributes those rows: the recent-requests table shows an **Overflow** or **Overflow · pinned** chip where the account would be (there is no account -- hiding the **Account** column hides the chip with it), the request detail view always names the source and its kind, and the request-log list offers a **Source** filter over exactly those two values. The chip, the filter and the tile below appear only once the installation has actually overflowed or holds live pins, so a deployment that never designated a source sees no new dashboard surface -- and pays nothing for it either: the overview skips the whole overflow read while both overflow settings columns are null, so a ship-dark poll issues exactly the queries it issued before this surface existed.
- **Overflow cost tile.** When overflow activity exists, the dashboard adds one tile summing `cost_usd` over the two `source` values inside the **overview's selected timeframe** (`1d`/`7d`/`30d`, the same window the other tiles use), next to the count of dispatched requests and of live pinned conversations. It is a **breakdown of `Est. API Cost`, not an addition to it**: overflow rows are ordinary request-log rows and are already inside that total. A window with no overflow shows `$0.00` and says so rather than disappearing, so the pins draining after a switch-off stay visible. Requests whose source reported no usage are counted separately instead of being priced at `$0` -- an estimate charged to a limited key is deliberately not written as row usage, so its spend is not in the sum. Two caveats: **decline counts are not on this tile** (they exist only as `codex_lb_subscription_overflow_total{outcome=...}` on the Prometheus port, which the dashboard does not read -- use Grafana), and the slice is computed from raw `request_logs`, so if you enable request-log retention it loses history that the rollup-backed `Est. API Cost` total keeps (retention is disabled by default).
- Log lines: `subscription_overflow_dispatched`, `subscription_overflow_pinned_unservable cause=…`, `subscription_overflow_pinned_released_neutral`, `model_source_breaker state=…`, `subscription_overflow_decision_error stage=…`, `model_source_pin_write outcome=…`. Configuration-class declines (undeclared tool types, unknown fields, Lite bodies) log a rate-limited WARN naming the offending type or field.

### Canary and drills

The designation is one fleet-wide settings row -- there is no per-replica flag -- so a canary that shares the production database would flip production. Run the canary as a **separate deployment with its own database**, designate a **low-limit, priced** source that serves a **standard-Responses** registry model (never a gpt-5.6 / Responses-Lite one), exhaust the canary's subscription pool, and complete this list before the production flip:

| Drill | How | Expected | Rehearsal |
|---|---|---|---|
| Disconnect | Press Esc in Codex while the source is still producing its first token. | One request-log row with status `cancelled`; no pin; the source slot released; the API-key reservation released; nothing reached the client. | `test_drill_disconnect_mid_dispatch_is_a_cancelled_attempt` |
| Stall | Point the source at a black-holed address, in both senses: an address that drops the SYN, and one that accepts TCP and then says nothing. | A dropped SYN answers `502 model_source_unreachable` before any `200`, because the connect phase never reaches the header wait; a source that accepts TCP and then stays silent answers `504 model_source_timeout` at the 20 s header deadline, again before any `200`; the breaker opens within three attempts; a fresh request then falls back to today's `429` without reaching the source; a pinned conversation gets `503 model_source_unavailable` with `Retry-After: 2`; the stalled source never touches the ChatGPT connector; ChatGPT traffic is unaffected. | `test_drill_stall_fails_closed_and_opens_the_breaker` |
| Silent headers | Source answers `200` and then nothing. | `504 model_source_timeout` at 30 s; nothing was sent to the client. | `test_drill_silent_headers_send_nothing_and_leave_no_pin` |
| Neutral release | Disable the source while a conversation without reasoning is pinned. | Its next turn is served by a subscription account; the pin is gone; a reasoning-bearing conversation gets `400 subscription_overflow_source_unavailable` and keeps its pin. | `test_drill_neutral_release_frees_a_source_free_conversation`, `test_drill_neutral_release_refuses_a_ciphertext_transcript_whatever_it_declares` |
| Clear-then-touch | Set the control to Off and keep using a pinned conversation daily. | The source serves it until day 7; never a subscription account; past the seventh idle day the pin is a tombstone -- a conversation the source owns is refused with `subscription_overflow_unsupported_input`; a source-free one is released to an account instead; the pin table is empty at the drain deadline. | `test_drill_clear_then_touch_expires_at_day_seven` |
| Kill switches | Off; then disable and delete the source. | Fresh overflow stops -- today's `429`, byte for byte; on every replica within the settings-cache window (≤ 5 s); pinned conversations drain; disabling or deleting releases a source-free conversation to a subscription account; a reasoning-bearing one ends with `400` and keeps its pin. | `test_drill_kill_switches_restore_subscription_behaviour` |
| Anchor timing | Send an SDK request (`store` omitted) through the designated source and read its SSE stream. | The source emits `response.created` with an `id` **before** its first content-bearing frame; given that, the anchor row exists and the turn is `200`; a source that mints its id later answers `subscription_overflow_pin_unavailable` on the SSE lifecycle; and it cannot serve SDK overflow turns at all. | `test_drill_anchor_timing_accepts_a_source_that_mints_its_id_first`, `test_drill_anchor_timing_refuses_an_unanchorable_sdk_turn` |

Also watch `codex_lb_subscription_overflow_total`, the request-log rows and the source cost over one usage-reset cycle; confirm a pinned conversation survives the pool's reset, `codex resume` and an API-key rotation, then tombstones after 7 idle days; and profile only with py-spy at 10-20 Hz in short bursts (higher rates stall a two-core host). Codex on the canary must be **0.99.0 or newer** for the WebSocket downgrade. Only after the drills pass, and once every production replica runs this release, designate the source in production.

#### Rehearse before the canary

```
make test-overflow-drills
```

(without `uv`: `PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python -m pytest -p no:cacheprovider -m overflow_drill tests/integration`)

One command, marker-selected, about a minute, in `tests/integration/test_subscription_overflow_canary_drills.py`, against the production route and forwarding stack. The contract between that suite and this table is per **clause**, not per row: every `;`-separated clause of an **Expected** cell is either asserted by one of the rehearsals its row names, or listed under **Not rehearsed** below with the observation that settles it. That contract is machine-checked -- `tests/unit/test_overflow_drill_coverage.py` maps each clause to the assertions that cover it, requires those clauses to reconstruct the **Expected** cell exactly, and requires those assertions to be *running*: the drill body is matched with comments and string statements blanked (a commented-out assertion covers nothing), and the drill itself is rejected when a `skip`/`skipif`/`xfail` mark reaches it, when it calls `pytest.skip()`, or when its body opens with a `return`, a `raise` or a `pass` -- each of which is reported as the clauses it leaves unrehearsed, by name. A promise added to this table without a rehearsal, an assertion deleted or commented out, or a whole drill quarantined, therefore fails the unit suite instead of the canary. What that check reads is the suite's source and the marker this page's command selects, not a live collection and not a run, so two things stay a reviewer's job: an assertion smothered where it stands (wrapped in a `try`, or under a condition that is never true) still reads as present, and a drill can still be hidden by stopping pytest from collecting it at all (a `conftest` ignore, an `addopts` deselection, a fixture that skips at setup). The run itself is what reports the second: read its summary, and confirm nothing is `skipped` and that all 9 `test_drill_*` rehearsals this table names ran (`-v` lists them by name). Which observables a clause pins is the clause's own business -- a drill that runs without an API key has no reservation to check, Disconnect and Silent headers pin the counters their own rows are about (`{stage}` on the abandonment counter, `{phase}` on the timeout counter) rather than the `codex_lb_subscription_overflow_total{outcome}` label, and only Stall is a row about the breaker. So no drill asserts the whole union of observables, and none of them claims to. Read a clause and its assertion together, and when you change one, change the other.

**What it proves:** the contracts. **What it does not:** the deployment. The rehearsal runs one replica, a stub upstream and the test database; the deadlines are shortened so the wire text still names the production value (20 s / 30 s) while the test finishes in a fraction of a second, and the calendar drills construct a past clear time instead of waiting a week. So run it *before* standing the canary up -- it is the cheap gate -- and then use the canary to verify only the residue below.

Two behaviours worth knowing, neither of them in the table:

- **A mid-stream cut is a truncation, not an error document.** A source that goes silent *after* its first frame is cut by the idle cap (`min(stream_idle_timeout_seconds, 300)`); the `200` has already left, so the client sees a stream that simply ends with no terminal event, for native and SDK shaping alike. The row is `error` / `model_source_idle_timeout`, the pin stays (the conversation is still the source's) and the breaker counts one failure. Rehearsed by `test_mid_stream_idle_cut_truncates_the_stream_without_a_terminal`.
- **Off restores the answer immediately, the zero-cost path at `drain_until`.** While the drain window is armed the request path still performs its bounded pin read on every thread-keyed and `previous_response_id` request -- the bytes are byte-identical to today's, the cost is not. The ship-dark fast path (no probe, no lookup, no selection, no portability walk, no claim) returns only once the drain deadline has passed, which is 29 days after the clear, not the moment the designation goes `NULL`. Rehearsed by `test_kill_switch_fast_path_returns_only_once_the_drain_deadline_elapses`.

#### Not rehearsed -- verify manually during the canary

Three clauses of the table have no rehearsal, because nothing in one process can settle them. Each names the observation that does:

- **Stall** -- clause "ChatGPT traffic is unaffected". The rehearsal's subscription pool is exhausted by construction -- that is what makes it an overflow test -- so there is no live ChatGPT turn for it to keep serving, and it asserts only the clause beside it: that the stalled source never touches the ChatGPT connector. *Observe:* with live accounts on the canary, keep a ChatGPT conversation going through the stall window; every turn must still be served while `codex_lb_model_source_breaker_state{source_id}` climbs to `1` on `/metrics` and `model_source_breaker` appears in the logs. Use a real firewall `DROP` (not `REJECT`), so the connect phase and the real 10 s bound are the ones under test.
- **Kill switches** -- clause "on every replica within the settings-cache window (≤ 5 s)". One replica cannot show propagation; the rehearsal asserts only that the switch takes effect on the replica that flipped it. *Observe:* flip Off and confirm every replica stops dispatching *fresh* overflow inside one window -- `codex_lb_subscription_overflow_total{outcome="dispatched_fresh"}` goes flat on each. Watch that outcome alone, not `dispatched_.*`: the next clauses of this same row promise that pinned conversations keep draining, so `dispatched_pinned` and `dispatched_anchor` go on incrementing for up to seven idle days after the flip and a selector covering them never goes flat.
- **Anchor timing** -- clause "The source emits `response.created` with an `id` **before** its first content-bearing frame". That is a property of the source, not of the proxy: the rehearsal supplies it with a stub that mints the id first, and pins that the proxy passes the ordering through to the client. *Observe:* read one raw SSE stream from the source (`curl -N`) and check that the first event is `response.created` and already carries `response.id`. The whole SDK-overflow capability depends on it.

And the rest of what the canary is for, beyond the table:

- **Disconnect.** Whether Codex re-dispatches after Esc, and whether the provider bills an aborted stream. `SELECT status, error_code, cost_usd, input_tokens FROM request_logs WHERE source LIKE 'subscription_overflow%' ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 5;` must show exactly one `cancelled` row with null usage; cross-check the provider's usage page for that minute.
- **Silent headers.** Whether the real source ever needs more than 30 s to its first frame: watch `codex_lb_model_source_timeout_total{phase="first_frame"}` over one reset cycle. Non-zero on healthy traffic means the deadline is the problem, not the source.
- **Neutral release.** One real Codex transcript: disable the source mid-conversation on the canary; the next turn must be served by an account, `outcome=pinned_released_neutral` must increment exactly once and the pin row must be gone.
- **Clear-then-touch.** The 7-day calendar and the retention pass: daily `SELECT kind, expires_at, purge_at FROM model_source_pins;` -- `purge_at` must always sit below `subscription_overflow_drain_until` and `model_source_pins_drain_invariant_violated` must never appear; at day 8 the conversation must fail with `subscription_overflow_unsupported_input`; at `drain_until` the table must be empty.

## HTTP to WebSocket promotion

Owning spec: [Responses API compatibility](https://github.com/Soju06/codex-lb/tree/main/openspec/specs/responses-api-compat).

With automatic upstream transport and the default `smart` HTTP policy, Responses
and subscription-backed Chat Completions can reuse upstream WebSocket connections
when requests carry response/cache/session identifiers, a `conversation`, tool
results, or an assistant response followed by new user input. A first request
containing only a user message remains HTTP. Native Codex HTTP callers follow
this policy too; their User-Agent alone does not indicate a WebSocket failure.

Real recent upstream WS failures temporarily keep requests on HTTP (the existing
60-second cooldown). Explicit HTTP policy, image-capable requests and oversized
payloads also bypass the bridge. Bypassing the bridge does not force upstream
HTTP: an `input_image` request keeps upstream HTTP only when its payload exceeds
the WebSocket frame budget or still carries an external image URL, and otherwise
follows the ordinary transport precedence. Source-routed Chat requests keep
their source.

Clients resending full history need not retain response headers to reuse a
connection. Inferred locality uses complete initial user input and instructions,
scoped to the API key. It remains a connection preference: the full history is
preserved, and an inferred key never authorizes response-anchor injection.

The dashboard's HTTP badge describes client-to-LB transport; the upstream field
shows the LB-to-provider transport. `codex_lb_http_bridge_routing_total` separates
`admission` from `bypass` with bounded reasons such as `smart_history`,
`smart_tool_result`, `smart_single_turn`, `recent_ws_failure`, `payload_size` and
`image`. Structured `http_bridge_routing` logs include the request ID.
`codex_lb_http_bridge_connections_total{event="reuse"}` measures actual connection
reuse; admission counts are not successful-connection counts. Existing TTFT and
queue latency metrics should be compared alongside reuse when measuring benefits.
